## Can You Deploy to cPanel/Nindohost?

**Short Answer:** ⚠️ **Maybe, but Laravel Forge is MUCH easier**

---

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | cPanel (Nindohost) | Laravel Forge |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Node.js Support** | ⚠️ Limited (need Node.js Manager) | ✅ Native/Built-in |
| **Setup Time** | ⏱️ 2-4 hours | ✅ 30 minutes |
| **Documentation** | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Excellent |

## ⚠️ cPanel Challenges

1. **Node.js Manager** may not be available
2. **Port restrictions** (can't use port 3000)
3. **Manual PM2 setup** required
4. **Less documentation** for Node.js
5. **More troubleshooting** needed

---

## ✅ Laravel Forge Advantages

1. **Native Node.js support**
2. **Easy deployment** (we already set it up!)
3. **Better documentation**
4. **Process management** built-in
5. **Everything configured** for you

## 🎯 Recommendation

**Use Laravel Forge** - We've already prepared everything:
- ✅ Nginx config ready
- ✅ PM2 config ready
- ✅ Deployment script ready
- ✅ Environment template ready
- ✅ All paths configured

**For cPanel:** You'd need to start from scratch.
